Description

Classifying spam

Use the Spambase dataset to classify spam. This data is already parsed down from email to features.  Subsample the data set so 60% is training data and 40% is test data. Subsamples taken at 75%.  The python program runs a simple Bayesian analysis.  Then it creates and tests the Bayesian classifier. Further testing of other Bayesian is also present.
