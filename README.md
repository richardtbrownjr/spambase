Classifying spam

Use the Spambase dataset to classify spam. This data is already parsed down from email to features.

Subsample the data set so 60% is training data and 40% is test data. You can subsample however you like, including splitting the original file. Just make sure that you have a representative data set. (The original is about 60% not-spam and 40% spam.)
